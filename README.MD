**LIVE: https://dearthfunk.github.io/visualizer/**

_Input Select Example_: https://github.com/webrtc/samples/tree/gh-pages/src/content/devices/input-output

**Controls**
Use the left and right arrow keys to cycle through the animations listed in the animations directory https://github.com/DearthFunk/visualizer/tree/main/animations 


**Running**

1. clone repo
2. run `npm install` to install
3. run `npx serve` to run the app


**TODO**
The goal here is to repurpose a subset of animations from https://github.com/DearthFunk/Animations to use with https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider which I am finally starting to Learn Learn. Have to figure out how to either pipe sound from a running SuperCollider app, connect directly to the sclang server, or replace the scide altogether (benefit here would be web-based ide where I could have ui to modify the interface opaquely over the visuals) I think? not really sure yet.. gotta learn it more.
